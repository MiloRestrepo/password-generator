# password-generator
## Description
- My motivation here was to be able to build a password generator, this is because it is so hard to always think of a new password so having something that can make it for you would make it easier for a lot of people to have strong and secure passwords.
- By having stronger passwords this means that people are harder to hack and or guess passwords, meaning that your account is a lot more secure.
- i learned that even just simple things like a password generator require so many different parts to make it work correctly and in the way that it is asked to be completed.
